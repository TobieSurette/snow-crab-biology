# Bitter crab disease

Bitter Crab Syndrome is a potentially fatal disease of snow crabs that is caused by a parasitic dinoflagellate of the genus *Hematodinium*. 
Over 40 crustacean species in North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have been identified as having *Hematodinium spp.* infections.

## *Hematodinium spp.*

Species belonging to the genus *Hematodinium* bear the key identifying characteristics of dinoflagellates. These include a dinokaryon, a pellicle, naked gymnodinoid dinospores, 
and dinomitosis. Because only a handful of species in this genus have been studied, there is a poor understanding of their life cycle.

Scientists speculate that spore ingestion is the main transmission pathway in which crustacean hosts acquire Hematodinium parasites (Shields, 1994). 
However, cannibalism with the ingestion of trophonts is another possibility. Vegetative cells known as trophonts are usually located in the host's hemolymph 
and quickly multiply via schizogony. Plasmodia containing 2 to 8 nuclei are motile in H. perezi. Sporulation follows, leading to the formation of prespores and 
then of dinospores. Dinospores supposedly exit the host through small openings in the carapace or through antennal glands. Macrospores are slightly larger than 
microspores by a few micrometers, and both are able to withstand ocean water conditions for several days.
